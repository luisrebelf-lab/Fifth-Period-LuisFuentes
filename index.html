<p>
	On my homepage, I created a proper structure with a header, navigation, and an area for my content. In order to create my hero I had to use divs in my paragraphs and titles. Each helped me add different sizes to the text, and if I wanted them to be bold or not. My CSS allowed for me to stylize all the pages while keeping it looking the same. In order to create the navigation on all pages, I just created a few lines of code in CSS that can be called back to on the HTML. Speaking of the navigation, each word/phrase is linked to a different page on my site! Allowing for people to go from one page to another at the simple click of a button. And for my image I have something I made in Photoshop from my graphic design class I took Junior year with the alt text of "Graphic Design". When adding the image I made it float to the left, and gave it a margin-right of 15 pixels. While I do have my 3 columns at the bottom, each with their own title, I have yet to add any links to them as I don't like how the "linked" CSS affects it, but I did use CSS to give it a light blue shadow when you hover over it. And I have yet to add any image or text to the column itself.
