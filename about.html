Portfolio Check
</h1>
<p>
In my about page I have many things, I used 3 paragraphs from my Digital Portfolio that includes my interests. Each paragraph is pretty similar from each other, not really any subtle changes. On each paragraph there's an image that correlates to my own personal interests added in a similar way to the image on the home page. The main difference between the 2 is that I used CSS in order to make the corners on the images slightly rounder. I decided to embed a song from youtube that I used to listen to a lot because of how calm it was, and in case anyone wanted to listen to it off of the website I made sure they were able to do so by making it an external link.

	As stated already, I'm Luis Fuentes and I created this page to tell you a little about who I am. Ever sense I was a child I have loved being able to make art, and for a while, all of my art pieces were physical in some sort. Drawing, paper mache, sculpting with clay, and the list goes on, but I wanted to learn how to make nice digital art and found the class graphic designs. I thought I might as well try the class as this can help me in careers later in the future, and spread the mediums I work on.</p1>

I have learned many skills within the small amount of time such as masks, and levels throughout my first semester on photoshop, and on illustrator I learned many things as how to use the pen tool and properties such as the trim tool. Masks are pretty easy to understand, what it does is creates a black area around the area you selected in photoshop, hiding hiding anything that is in black, while anything in white is shown. Using the brush tool you can either hide more of an image or show more of an image using black or white. In illustrator I used the pen tool in practically everything, which in this class was mostly designs, or other artwork, and assignments that we were assigned. And now I am curently learning how to code as well! So far I have learned to code in HTML, and CSS.</p2>

After high-school I would love to continue my education in college, there is never to much you can learn. And I would love to get a job focused on creating posters, sketches, and much more for companies and people alike. There is so much that I could do with graphic design and I am not a hundred percent sure what I am going to do in my future, but I have an idea with what I will do later on. The best things in life will always start with just an idea.</p3>
